content: "My vision for this website was simplicity for the design in order to make the photographs pop out. I used Hugo, a fast framework for building websites, and included the Netifly CMS for content management. Because there are so many large high-quality photos, we decided to use Cloudinary to help us deliver fast loading photos while maintaining the quality.The Welcome Page features handwritten logo design and a carousel effect of full-scale photographs."
